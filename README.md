# Weekly allowance program

This repository contains a Python program that simulates the management of a weekly allowance using various Python assignment and arithmetic operators. 

# Problem description

You are given a weekly allowance of 2000. the task is to write a Python program that tracks the changes in your allowance throughout the week based on expenses incured.

# The expenditure are:

1. Purchase of book worth 1600, then print yor balance. (2000-=400)
2. Add 100 which you find under your bed to your allowance and print your balance. (1600+=100)
3. Buy snacks worth 250 and print what is left.(1700-=250)
4. Give 25% of your current balance to your younger sibling and print the balance. (1450-=362.5)
5. Use one third of whats left to purchase data, then print the balance. (1087.5-=362.0)
6. Split the remaining balance equally between savings and tighting (725.0//2)
7. Using the modulo assignment operator (%=), determine how many 100 can be made from the balance and print the final balance thats left from your weekly allowance.(362.0%=100).

The actual output will be displayed when you run the script, you will see the balance after each step.
